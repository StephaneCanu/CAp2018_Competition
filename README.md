# Starter kit for the [CAp 2018 compatition](http://cap2018.litislab.fr/competition-en.html) My Tailor is rich! Predicting English level by analyzing writing styles. 

In May 2018, the CAp 2018 conference  hosted a machine learning competition,  sponsored by Nvidia. 
The goal of this competition was to achieve, by learning, a system to predict the level of competence of a learner, from one of these written productions comprising between 20 and 300 words and a set of characteristics calculated from this text.
The aim was to and favour cross-fertilisation among linguists and specialists of Natural intelligence.

This companion webpage contain the code used for the evaluation (in R, Python and Matlab). It shows the details of how the matrix cost is calculated for each submission. This kind of corpus challenge only lacks the full availability that ensured the evolution  of machine learning.
